# EasyWAM Configuration Guide

[中文](README_zh.md) | [Back to README](../../../README.md)

EasyWAM uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) to compose training, data, model, and task configuration. This directory explains how the configuration groups fit together and how to tune them without copying an entire task file.

## Configuration layout

```text
configs/
├── train.yaml                 # Global training and model-execution defaults
├── data/                      # Dataset, processor, cameras, and normalization
├── model/
│   ├── backbone/              # Backbone paths, dimensions, and attention settings
│   ├── lora/                  # LoRA adapter settings
│   └── easywam_*.yaml         # EasyWAM architecture definitions
├── task/                      # Ready-to-run data + model + training recipes
└── benchmark/sim_*.yaml       # Benchmark evaluation defaults
```

`configs/train.yaml` is the root training configuration. A task config overrides its `data` and `model` groups and then applies benchmark-specific training values. Model configs compose a backbone and, for LoRA recipes, a LoRA config.

```text
train.yaml
└── task=libero_easywam_mot_wan22_lora
    ├── data=libero
    └── model=easywam_mot_wan22_lora
        ├── backbone=wan22
        └── lora=video_dit
```

Use a task recipe for normal training and evaluation. Override `data=` or `model=` directly only when building a new recipe and after checking that action/state dimensions and backbone dimensions remain compatible.

## Write a task recipe

Create `configs/task/<dataset>_easywam_<architecture>_<backbone>.yaml`. The task selects an existing data config and model config; it does not duplicate their camera, normalization, or architecture settings. For example, the RoboCasa MoT-Joint recipe is:

```yaml
# @package _global_
defaults:
  - override /data: robocasa
  - override /model: easywam_mot_joint_wan22
  - _self_

batch_size: 16
num_workers: 8
lr_scheduler_type: cosine
learning_rate: 1e-4
max_steps: 30000
log_every: 100
save_every: 3000
eval_every: 1000
eval_num_inference_steps: 10
gradient_accumulation_steps: 1
weight_decay: 1e-2
resume: null
```

Keep `_self_` after the group overrides so task values take precedence. RoboTwin, RoboCasa, and RoboDojo each ship five Wan2.2 architectures: `mot`, `hidden`, `unified`, `mot_joint`, and `mot_idm`; RoboCasa and RoboDojo use the same training values as RoboTwin. LIBERO retains its broader set of task recipes. The absence of a prewritten `_lora` task for another dataset does not remove LoRA support: create a task selecting the matching `_lora` model. To add another dataset, first define its `configs/data/<dataset>.yaml` and verify the action/state dimensions against the selected model, then create the task file. Check the result with `python scripts/train.py --cfg job task=<task-name>` before precomputing text embeddings or training. See [training configuration](training.md) for the meaning of each field.

## Inspect and override configuration

Print the fully composed training configuration without starting a run:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --cfg job task=libero_easywam_mot_wan22
```

Hydra overrides use dotted keys. Later command-line values take precedence over values composed from `train.yaml` and the task:

```bash
NPROC_PER_NODE=8 bash scripts/train_zero1.sh \
  task=libero_easywam_mot_wan22 \
  batch_size=12 \
  learning_rate=5e-5 \
  model.loss.lambda_action=2.0 \
  model.backbone.attention_backend=auto
```

Quote list overrides so that the shell does not interpret brackets:

```bash
python experiments/libero_plus/run_libero_plus_manager.py \
  task=libero_easywam_mot_wan22 \
  'MULTIRUN.task_suite_names=[libero_spatial]' \
  'MULTIRUN.categories=[camera,light]'
```

Hydra does not change the working directory in this project (`hydra.job.chdir=false`), so relative dataset, checkpoint, cache, and output paths are resolved from the directory where the command is launched. Run commands from the repository root unless every relative path is adjusted.

## Topics

| Topic | English | 中文 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Models, backbones, LoRA, and losses | [Model configuration](models.md) | [模型配置](models_zh.md) |
| Data, training, logging, and evaluation | [Training configuration](training.md) | [训练配置](training_zh.md) |
| Throughput, memory, and inference latency | [Efficiency configuration](efficiency.md) | [效率配置](efficiency_zh.md) |

Benchmark installation, task selection, and result-resume behavior are covered by the [LIBERO](../benchmark/libero.md), [LIBERO-Plus](../benchmark/libero_plus.md), and [RoboTwin](../benchmark/robotwin.md) guides.

## Recommended workflow

1. Choose the closest task recipe from `configs/task/`.
2. Update checkpoint and dataset paths through command-line overrides or a new task recipe.
3. Inspect the composed configuration with `--cfg job`.
4. Precompute text embeddings with the same task selection used for training.
5. Start from the checked-in defaults, then tune memory and throughput settings for the target hardware.

Keep reusable experiment choices in a task YAML. Reserve command-line overrides for paths, short experiments, and values intentionally varied between runs.
